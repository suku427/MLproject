# Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Project** repository! This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning techniques, developed in Google Colab.

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to solve a specific problem, with clear steps and well-documented code. Below, you’ll find details about the workflow, dataset, and tools used.

## Features
- Implements machine learning algorithms.
- Provides exploratory data analysis.
- Includes visualizations to explain findings.
- Step-by-step documentation for reproducibility.

## Structure
- **Notebook**: Contains 20 cells, including:
  - **12 Code Cells**: Feature implementation, model training, and evaluation.
  - **8 Markdown Cells**: Explanations, context, and results.

## Requirements
To run the project, you’ll need:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Key Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` (specific versions may vary and are detailed in the notebook).

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
4. Run the cells in sequence to reproduce the results.

## Results
- Provides insights into the dataset.
- Visualizations and metrics for evaluating model performance.
- Suggestions for future improvements.
